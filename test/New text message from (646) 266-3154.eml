Hi Paul,
Here's an example of the large number of updates happening on any reply
from phone@ to support@ as well as the external phone number (646) texting
with the SCN phone.

Ticket #323 has been updated by Phone SCN.


Trying again sending a reply all from phone@ email with fwding filter for
SMS reply set up through support@ and not redmine@. Last time this type of
reply caused a lot of ticket updates.
