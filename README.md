## Development Log

### 2023-08-23
Starting work on a new bot, from scratch, based on https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/blob/master/examples/app_commands/slash_autocomplete.py

Adding initial requirement.txt and setting up `venv`:

```
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install py-cord
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Simple example runs but fails auth. How is auth handled? Sending a token in the bot run command.

Using `.env` file for auth, with a var named `DISCORD_TOKEN`

```
pip install python-dotenv
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
